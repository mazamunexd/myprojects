                    <p>Iskolar ng Bayan (Scholars of the Nation) is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees.
                    <br>
                    The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) originated as the Manila Business School (MBS) on October 19, 1904, to meet the need for trained personnel in government and private sectors. It was renamed the Philippine School of Commerce (PSC) in 1908 and merged with the Philippine Normal School from 1933 to 1946. In 1952, the PSC became the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) through Republic Act 778, and later, in 1978, it was established as a chartered state university under the name Polytechnic University of the Philippines by Presidential Decree Number 1341.
                    <br>
                    PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution focused on enhancing the nation's human resources through higher education in commerce, business administration, and technology. The University emphasizes applied research, advanced studies, and leadership, offering various vocational, distance learning, and technical programs. It aims to equip students with employable skills and managerial knowledge to foster creativity and self-reliance.
                    <br>
                    Operating year-round with two semesters and optional summer sessions, PUP employs over 2,000 faculty members and 1,381 administrative staff. Faculty members dedicate two-thirds of their time to teaching and one-third to research and extension activities, with research being a vital aspect of the University’s mission. 
                    With more than twenty campuses and a student population exceeding 97,000, PUP is the largest university in the Philippines. Its main campus, named after national hero Apolinario Mabini, is located in Sta. Mesa, Manila, providing a conducive learning environment amidst the bustling city.

                    <p>Majority of the students belong to the economically challenged level of society. It is the University's commitment to give qualified and talented students access to quality and responsive education to aid them in the achievement of their dreams and improve their lives. Being a well-educated and skilled individual, they will not only become job seekers but job creators as well, a force of knowledge workers and entrepreneurs.
                    <br>
                    Iskolar ng Bayan (Scholars of the Nation) is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees. More than a hundred of the student population are foreigners from China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana. They are enrolled in business, language, statistics, communication, and education courses in the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students from Korea regularly visit PUP in summer to take up Intensive English courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Polytechnic University of the Philippines takes pride in its capability to accommodate the students because it:</p>

                    <p>The commitment of its leaders, faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends has formed the cornerstone of this University that has exceeded expectations with every generation of the graduates it has produced since its establishment.
                    <br>
                    Today, PUP is relishing its successes and its students are enjoying unprecedented academic opportunities, an enhanced campus environment, upgraded colleges, state-of-the-art technology, and nationally and internationally recognized programs.
                    <br>
                    PUP celebrated 120 years last October 2024. It has gone far from what it was more than a century ago. This is mainly due to the support given by the government and the PUP Community and its benefactors. With the combined effort, PUP will continue to be a partner in nation-building and in poverty alleviation for the marginalized sector of society with quality, responsive, and relevant education as a tool.
