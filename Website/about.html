                    <p>Iskolar ng Bayan (Scholars of the Nation) is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees.

                    The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) originated as the Manila Business School (MBS) on October 19, 1904, to meet the need for trained personnel in government and private sectors. It was renamed the Philippine School of Commerce (PSC) in 1908 and merged with the Philippine Normal School from 1933 to 1946. In 1952, the PSC became the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) through Republic Act 778, and later, in 1978, it was established as a chartered state university under the name Polytechnic University of the Philippines by Presidential Decree Number 1341.
                    <br>
                    PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution focused on enhancing the nation's human resources through higher education in commerce, business administration, and technology. The University emphasizes applied research, advanced studies, and leadership, offering various vocational, distance learning, and technical programs. It aims to equip students with employable skills and managerial knowledge to foster creativity and self-reliance.
                    <br>
                    Operating year-round with two semesters and optional summer sessions, PUP employs over 2,000 faculty members and 1,381 administrative staff. Faculty members dedicate two-thirds of their time to teaching and one-third to research and extension activities, with research being a vital aspect of the University’s mission. 
                    With more than twenty campuses and a student population exceeding 97,000, PUP is the largest university in the Philippines. Its main campus, named after national hero Apolinario Mabini, is located in Sta. Mesa, Manila, providing a conducive learning environment amidst the bustling city.
